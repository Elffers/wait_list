Ada Developers Academy is a school about technology. Yet, often when we are working on projects, we don't use technology to optimize the ways in which we use our most valuable resource -- our TAs and instructors. Thus far in the program, whenever one of us needs help, we walk to the whiteboard, and put our names on a list. 

This is an okay system, but not a good or even great one. There are many problems, including the fact that we have to literally get up and walk over to the board; but we have computers! The computers should be doing the work for us.

This app allows members of ADA to add themselved to the help queue, and remove themselves once someone comes over to help. There are several features currently in place, and more to come.

Currently an Adie can:

- Add a name to the queue
- Input details about the problem, including what type of problem it is, and an estimated length of time the question will take
-Remove herself once she's been helped.
-Push the relax button to help work off some of the stress

Features to Come:

-Avatars attached to the names so that a TA knows which Adie needs help
-Sign in or some sort of authentication so that only an Adie can add/remove herself from the list
-A wait time
-Adding more than one Adie to a problem, in the case of pair-programming


Note: 
Currently the problems are "retired" but not destroyed. Long-term I hope to use this system to be able to perform some analysis on the types of questions we have and how long it takes for them to be answered, in the hopes of further optimizing our classroom resources.

If you have ideas for features or want to help with the code, feel free to submit a pull request.



Very enjoy. So helping. Wow.
