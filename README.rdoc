During project time, ADA students often put their names on the board to get help from instructors and TAs.  
But sometimes, we forget to erase our names after being help.  Because now that we're developers, 
we don't like leaving our computers, even for a little bit.
So, this app allows folks to get added to the cue of those needing help.

Very enjoy. So helping. Wow.
